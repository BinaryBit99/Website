    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I am currently a third year University of Calgary student majoring in electrical engineering and minoring in physics.</p>
    <p>I decided to pursue electrical engineering because I am passionate about systematically creating final products that have practical applications.</p>
    <p>For the last 60 units - 20 courses - my GPA has remained at 3.6</p>
    <p>Below is a list of courses I have taken  at the University of Calgary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ENSF 337 - Programming with C/C++</li>
            <li>ENDG 233 - Programming with Data (Python)</li>
            <li>ENGG 225 - Circuits 1</li>
            <li>ENEL 343 - Circuits 2 (Laplace Analysis)</li>

            <li>ENEL 353 - Digital Principles</li>
            <li>ENCM 369 - Computer Organization</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>Below is a list of courses I am currently taking: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ENEL 453 - Digital Design (SystemVerilog/VHDL)</li>

        </ul>
    
    
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Throughout my teenage years, I worked through numerous part-time retail jobs: barista, line cook, cashier, and so on.</p>
    <p>These experiences helped me acquire a strong work-ethic and to realize the importance of being a team player.</p>
    <p>Now, I am working as a private tutor in my neighbourhood, at mathnasium - a math learning center for K-12 students, - and at the University of Calgary as a TA (teaching assistant) for some first year engineering courses (ENDG 233  - Programming with Data and ENGG 225 - Circuits 1, or Basic Circuits).</p>
    <p>Besides the experiences listed above, I also have some experience in industry. During the summer in 2023 I worked as a business analyst summer intern at Pembina Pipeline Corp., a midstream energy provider in Western Canada</p>
    
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>I am currently looking for summer 2025 internships. I am a very disciplined and hard-working individual, and I know that I will make a difference if I am given a chance to prove it.</p>
    <p>After school, I plan on enrolling in an MS thesis-based electrical engineering program at the University of Calgary so I can have more technical expertise that I can apply while working in industry.</p>
